# GOLDEN PATH 🚚✨
**Conceptual Smart Route Optimization System for Delivery Companies**

## Overview
GOLDEN PATH is a **conceptual prototype** of an intelligent delivery route planning system.  
Developed as part of the **System Analysis and Design (968-250)** course at **Prince of Songkla University, Phuket Campus**, this project explores how logistics companies can optimize routes for multiple deliveries using smart calculations and real-time adjustments.  

⚠️ **Note:** This project is currently a **conceptual model / academic prototype** and not a production-ready system. It is designed for further development, research, and potential real-world application in logistics and transportation.  

## Features
- 🔎 **Multi-destination route calculation** – automatically finds the best sequence for deliveries.  
- ⚡ **Real-time adjustments** – adapts routes based on traffic or emergencies.  
- 📍 **GPS tracking integration (concept)** – monitors delivery vehicle locations.  
- 📊 **Dashboard & reporting** – provides insights into travel distance, fuel usage, and delivery performance.  
- 🔔 **Notification system (concept)** – alerts drivers and managers to changes or issues.  
- 🌱 **Eco-friendly design** – helps reduce CO₂ emissions by optimizing fuel consumption.  

## Objectives
1. Explore the feasibility of automated multi-destination route optimization.  
2. Demonstrate how intelligent systems can reduce delivery costs and time.  
3. Provide a foundation for future logistics software solutions.  
4. Improve service quality and customer satisfaction through better planning.  

## System Workflow (Conceptual)
1. Input delivery details and destinations.  
2. System validates data and calculates optimized routes.  
3. Drivers receive suggested navigation guidance.  
4. Managers track deliveries through a dashboard.  
5. Reports are generated after delivery completion.  

## Technologies (Prototype)
- **Google Maps API** for route visualization.  
- **Basic GPS integration (planned concept)** for vehicle tracking.  
- **Simulated notifications and reporting features.**  

## Benefits
- 🚀 Faster deliveries (conceptual).  
- 💰 Reduced transportation costs (fuel, labor, maintenance).  
- 👨‍💻 Easy-to-use design for drivers and managers.  
- 🌍 Environmentally friendly by reducing fuel consumption.  

## Future Improvements
- Real-time rerouting during traffic incidents or bad weather.  
- AI-based delivery time predictions.  
- Integration with enterprise logistics management systems.  
- Expansion to IoT devices such as drones or automated vehicles.
